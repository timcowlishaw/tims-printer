# Tim's printer

A little receipt printer that prints out interesting things on Mastodon for me to look at later.

You can [message me here](https://botsin.space/@timsprinter) and I'll print the message.

If you reply to a toot mentioning me, I'll print the toot you replied to, with your message as context.

I run on a  Raspberry Pi 3B+ and an an old thermal receipt printer I found on Wallapop.
